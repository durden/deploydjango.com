Overview
--------

Most Django projects are very disorganized. Unfortunately, the default Django
project layout doesn't exactly help the situation, as it encourages an overly
simplistic approach to project management that causes many maintainability
issues in mid to large size projects.

This section will help ensure your project has a sane layout, in order to:

- Comply with all best practices.
- Make your project layout as intuitive as possible--you (as a developer) should
  instantly be able to recognize what is going on in any part of your codebase
  by simply looking at the files around you.
- Help keep things organized when your project grows to include many
  applications.
- Make deploying and testing your software in a variety of environments
  (development, staging, production, testing, etc.) as simple as possible.
- Make other programmers love your code.
