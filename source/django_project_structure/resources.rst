Resources
---------

Properly organizing and managing Django projects requires a large set of
skills. Below I've included relevant resources that will not only give you a
great understanding of Django and Python, but also help you understand why
these best practices are the way they are.

I'd highly recommend reading through some of the resources listed below if you
have a chance.


Books
*****

These are some of my favorite books on Django, Python, and project management
which can help you gain a deeper understanding of your project's internals,
organization, and layout. These books are ordered in terms of complexity, with
simpler material (more suitable for beginners) listed first.


Django Books
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Django 1.0 Website Development
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847196780/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1847196780>`_
- `The Definitive Guide to Django: Web Development Done Right
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143021936X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=143021936X>`_
- `Practical Django Projects
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219386/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430219386>`_
- `Pro Django
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210478/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430210478>`_
- `Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847197566/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1847197566>`_

I highly, **highly** recommend that even if you're an advanced Django
programmer you read through `Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging
<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847197566/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1847197566>`_,
if nothing else. It is my favorite book on Django, and covers an incredible
amount of material that is absolutely indispensable.


Python Books
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_
- `Dive Into Python
  <href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590593561/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590593561>`_
- `Pro Python
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430227575/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430227575>`_
- `Expert Python Programming: Best Practices for Designing, Coding, and Distributing Your Python Software
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184719494X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=184719494X>`_

While `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_ is a
book tailored to beginners, it still contains great information on the
language. If you're coming to Python from a background in another language,
give it a quick read through.

The other books listed above are for developers already familiar with Python,
and dive into much more advanced usage.
