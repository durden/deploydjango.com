Resources
--------

PostgreSQL is a complex database system, and no matter how much experience you
have with it, there will always be a lot left to learn. Below are some
resources that I've found helpful, and I hope you do too.

If you were to read your way through the resources below from start to finish
you should have not only a solid grasp on PostgreSQL itself, but also a firm
understanding of all the provided features, how PostgreSQL works behind the
scenes, and how to manage and administrate your own PostgreSQL databases in
high performance environments.


Books
*****

The following books are absolutely excellent, and highly recommended to anyone
who works with PostgreSQL on a daily basis.

- `Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL: From Novice to Professional
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590594789/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590594789>`_

- `PostgreSQL 9 Administration Cookbook
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849510288/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1849510288>`_

- `PostgreSQL 9.0 High Performance
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184951030X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=184951030X>`_

- `PostgreSQL (2nd Edition)
  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672327562/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rdegges-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0672327562>`_


Tutorials
*********

The only tutorial worth reading is the `official PostgreSQL documentation
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/index.html>`_. While it is
verbose and a bit difficult to read through sequentially, it is very well
written and is the first place you should look for answers to your questions.

If you've never worked with PostgreSQL before, or lack basic understand of
relational databases, you should probably read through one of the books
linked above instead, as you'll have a much easier time learning the system and
getting started.
