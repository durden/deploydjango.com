In any given project, you (as a developer) should be able to look in the root
directory and immediately see:

- A ``manage.py`` script for managing your Django website.
- A ``requirements.txt`` file which specifies all the `PyPI
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ packages your project depends on, and their
  explicitly named versions.
- An excellent ``README.md`` file which contains information about the site
  (including where to find the full documentation).
- A ``docs`` directory which contains `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ documentation.
- A ``fabfile.py`` script for performing various management tasks (written
  using `Fabric <http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.1/index.html>`_.
- And last, but not least: your Django project directory itself.
