Resources
---------

While I've tried to give you a good overview of Heroku here, there is quite a
bit more to learn. Depending on your current skill level, you may want to read
through some of the resources listed below.

Since using Heroku revolves around the use of Git, I strongly recommend you
become a Git wizard, as it will make your life much easier as you go on.


Books
*****

These are both excellent books on Git. If you're a complete beginner with Git,
you should read through both books, as the first is a lot more entry level,
and the latter contains more complex topics and advanced usage.

- `Pragmatic Guide to Git
