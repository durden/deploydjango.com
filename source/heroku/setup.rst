Setup
-----

Getting started with Heroku is simple. There are four major things you'll need
to do:

1. Create an account on http://www.heroku.com/.
2. Install the `Heroku toolbelt <https://toolbelt.heroku.com/>`_.
3. Install the `Heroku accounts <https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts>`_
   plugin.
4. Have a Django 1.4 site that you'd like to deploy to Heroku.

Through the rest of this site--you'll be expected to have the above working and
ready to go. I'll walk you through steps 2 and 3, but steps 1 and 4 are up to
you.

Before you go any further, sign up for an account on Heroku:
https://api.heroku.com/signup.
